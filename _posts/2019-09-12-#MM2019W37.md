##  #MakeoverMonday 2019 Week 37
*This project is based on the popular [#MakeoverMonday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MakeoverMonday?src=hashtag_click&pf=on) data initiative run by Tableau Zen Master, [Andy Kriebel](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/), and [Eva Murray](https://trimydata.com/), Head of Business Intelligence at Exasol. Each week they provide an article that contains a data visualization and data set. Participants are able to look at the data set and see if they can come up with a better story, a different story by redesigning the chart using Tableau.*

My take on week 37 data visualization challenge using Tableau and the data set downloadable at [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w37).

### First, a look at the original visualization based on Jane Austen's novels.

- Good use of a black background with multiples colors of data bubbles showing different books.

### Second, a description of the data set.
The data, which comes from [Seattle's open data website](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data), concerns the Seattle Public Library and the number of monthly checkout of James Patterson books. Crime and blood are not scenes that regularly make up my reading repertoire, yet a week ago those physical disturbances did come up when I read Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon. Though not as gory as Mr Patterson's work I'm sure.
