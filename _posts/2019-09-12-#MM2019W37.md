#  #MakeoverMonday 2019 Week 37
*This project is based on the popular #MakeoverMonday data initiative run by Tableau Zen Master, [Andy Kriebel](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/), and [Eva Murray](https://trimydata.com/), Head of Business Intelligence at Exasol. Each week they provide an article that contains a data visualization and data set. Participants look at the data set and see if they can come up with a better story, a different story by redesigning the chart using Tableau.*

My take on week 37 data visualization challenge using Tableau and the data set provided at [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w37).

### First, the original visualization based on Jane Austen's novels.

### Second, a description of the data set.
The data, which comes from [Seattle's open data website](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data), is about the Seattle Public Library and the number of monthly checkout of James Patterson books.
