*[Note] This project is based on the popular #MakeoverMonday data initiative run by Tableau Zen Master, Andy Kriebel, and Eva Murray. Every week they provide an article that contains a data visualization to be redesigned by the tableau community.*

My take on week 37 data visualization challenge using Tableau and the data set provided at [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w37).

### First, the original visualization.

### Second, a description of the data set.
It is about the Seattle Public Library and the number of monthly checkout of James Patterson books.
